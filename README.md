# python-GUI-model

This project includes a number of sample python files which contain example applications of the [wx-python](https://wxpython.org/pages/overview/index.html) module. The sample application provided here aims to teach users how numbers are represented in computer systems, including; binary, hexadecimal, ASCII, Unicode and the basics of binary arithmetic. 

While the application is quite crude and is in need of imporvments it does offer a decent overview of several applications of the wx-python module to GUI (graphical user interface) construction with python.
